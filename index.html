      <h2>Nuclear Fission</h2>
      <p>All nuclear power plants use nuclear fission, and most nuclear power plants use uranium atoms. During nuclear fission, a neutron collides with a uranium atom and splits it, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. More neutrons are also released when a uranium atom splits. These neutrons continue to collide with other uranium atoms, and the process repeats itself over and over again.

      <h2>Why Nuclear Energy Is Useful</h2>
      <p>Nuclear energy protects air quality by producing massive amounts of carbon-free electricity. Nuclear energy is the most reliable energy source, nuclear power plants run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They are designed to operate for longer stretches and refuel every 1.5 â€“ 2 years. In 2019, nuclear plants operated at full power more than 92% of the time, making it the most reliable energy source today.</p>
