			<h2>Nuclear Fission</h2>
			<p>All nuclear power plants use nuclear fission, and most nuclear power plants use uranium atoms because it is one of
				the most unstable elements. During nuclear fission, a neutron collides with a uranium atom and splits it, releasing a
				large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. These neutrons continue to collide with other uranium atoms,
				and the process repeats itself over and over again.

			<h2>The Benefits of Nuclear Energy</h2>
			<p>Nuclear energy protects air quality by producing massive amounts of carbon-free electricity. Nuclear energy is the
				most reliable energy source, nuclear power plants run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They are designed to operate for
				longer stretches and refuel every 1.5 â€“ 2 years. In 2019, nuclear plants operated at full power more than 92% of the
				time, making it the most reliable energy source today.</p>

			<h2>The Common Misconceptions About Nuclear Power</h2>
			<p>Nuclear power has always been viewed in a negative light most likly because of the shock that came with the nuclear bombs,
				the Three Mile Island incident, the Chernobyl disaster, and the Fukushima incident but these were caused by human negligence
				or natural disasters. The most notable nuclear disasters caused by nuclear powerplants were the Fukushima and Chernobyl of which only 30 people died directly in the Cheronbyl disaster while for Fukushima, only 16 people were injured right after
				the disaster.

      <h2>Safety Precautions For Nuclear Power Plants<h2>
      <h5>There are specific rules to follow to ensure that workers and civilians are safe.</h5> 
      <ol>
      <li>Any personal must be protected from radiation. </li>
      <li> air contamination levels must be maintained below 1/10 Derived Air Concentration</li>
      <li>materials must not be exposed radiation.</li>
      <li>radiation level are kept under design level</li> 
      </ol>

				<h2>How Nuclear Energy Can Stop Global Warming </h2>
			</header>
			<p>The cause of Global Warming is mainly carbon       emmision and the majority of the waste is           produced in powerplants and compared to fossil fuels nuclear power plants create the least amount of carbon emmissons..</p>
